# 2024 Electrical Competition Problem H Code Project

This is a CCS project using Ti MSPM0L1306. All questions have been implemented with a 5V battery power supply.

Sensors used are JY901 and an eight-channel grayscale sensor.

## Implemented Functions

- Motor encoder counting
- Reading data from JY901 nine-axis gyro
- TB6612 motor drive
- I2C reading grayscale sensor feedback data
- Speed control using PID
- Single button for selecting different tasks
